### Tandoori Inn

This place has always been legendary for its birayani and i have a lot of childhood memories asociated with it. My favourite dishes from this restaurant are ***Chicken briyani*** and ***Chicken tandoori***.

**Chicken tandoori is famous for its versatility and unique flavor since we marinate the chicken in spices and yogurt and then cook in the tandoor at high heat which resulting in a moist and flavorful chicken**. When i visit my homecountry i would like to visit this restaurant again.
